        Hi, I'm Vaibhav! I am a software developer specializing in web
        development, with a primary focus on JavaScript and its frameworks. My
        expertise lies in developing and maintaining robust, modern webpages and
        web applications. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Applications from
        the College of Engineering Roorkee. This weather app is a personal
        project, built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It demonstrates
        my ability to create efficient and intuitive user interfaces without
        relying on external frameworks. The app provides accurate, real-time
        weather updates in a clean and responsive design. I plan to enhance the
        app in the future by adding more advanced features like weather
        forecasting, historical data, and personalized themes.
